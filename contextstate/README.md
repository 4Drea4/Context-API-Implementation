# Todo with Context API
## Andrea E - Dec. 19<sup>th<sup>

### Scenario Scope:
You are tasked with building a functional Todo application. Instead of relying on prop drilling or a complex third-party state management library for this scale, you will leverage React’s Context API to manage various aspects of the application’s state. This includes managing the list of todos, current visibility filters, and a simple theme.

This lab will provide practical experience in designing multiple contexts, implementing providers, consuming context values in components, and handling more involved state updates. You will also explore basic persistence and optimization considerations with Context.
